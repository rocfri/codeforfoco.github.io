## Daniel Walker

I'm a developer currently working at <a href="http://www.datasplice.com">DataSplice</a> in Old Town Fort Collins. I've been coding for around 15 years. The first half was mostly backe-end (Java/Spring Framework, and a little C# and Rails). Most recently have been focusing on HTML5 web and mobile apps. I enjoy functional programming, and am interested in languages and libraries such as JS, Elm, F#. I grew up in England, but have lived in the U.S. since 2005. I was also in the U.S. Air Force for a while as a weather forecaster.

I'm  <a href="https://github.com/plaxdan">@plaxdan</a> on Github and <a href="https://twitter.com/plaxdan">@plaxdan</a> on Twitter and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/plaxdan">plaxdan</a> on LinkedIn.
